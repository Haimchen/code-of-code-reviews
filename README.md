# code-of-code-reviews

This collection of rules aims to make a Code of Conduct more actionable:
It provides concrete examples that can help everyone to write better comments on code reviews.
Feel free to reference this in your own open source repo, use it to improve team communication at work or fork it to adapt it to your CoC!

The Code of Code Reviews is also supposed to be a collaborative effort, so if you feel a rule is missing, please open a PR or a issue.

### Why we need the CoCR

Many open source projects are looking for motivated contributors.
But opening a PR that will be reviewed by some stranger can be a daunting task.
Many first time contributors are discouraged when their changes are met with comments that are perceived as condescending or even rude.

On the other hand, if you take the time to review someone else' code, you should make sure this time was spend productively.
And criticism and suggestions are much better received when they are shared in a friendly and constructive manner.

Many of the rules you find here might seem obvious to you, but sometimes it is useful to see something written down.

# The Rules

- Be nice - [see examples](#be-nice)


### Be nice

> Aim to appear friendly in your comments. This can be hard to do in writing, but luckily github supports emojis 🎉
> And obviously: Never be rude or use strong language (or this guy -> 💩).

##### Why?

People are more likely to listen to advice and criticism if they do not feel personally attacked or put down.
Also remember that the person reading your comment spend their free time working on a project you both care about.
A friendly reception is more likely to encourage them to contribute more and an active community is the heart of every open source project.

##### Examples

🚨 Can be improved:
```
Does this have to be all in one file?
```
**Why?**
Can be read as passiv aggressive or annoyed.

💚 Good:
```
It looks like you forgot to remove this comment 😉 
```

💚 Good:
```
Would you mind splitting this code in a few methods so it can be reused? Thank you 🎁
```
